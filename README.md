# SQLog

Embed log for go apps


**SQLog** is a **Golang** library that leverages the power of **slog** to streamline log management in a simple and efficient way. One of its key advantages is its integration with **SQLite**, an embedded database, meaning there's no need for an external database server setup. This reduces operational costs and drastically simplifies system maintenance, as everything runs **embedded**, without complex dependencies.

With **SQLog**, you get a lightweight and robust solution for securely logging and storing data, using **SQLite** to ensure data persistence and integrity. It's ideal for developers looking for a practical, cost-effective, and reliable way to monitor their applications, without sacrificing performance.
